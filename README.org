* Reformation
** Overview
Reformation is a library for building web forms.  More specifically, the library outputs Clojure data structures that can be easily rendered by Reagent.

It has one main method, =render-application=, which takes two arguments:

 - a data structure describing the form, 
 - a place to store the data---either an atom, or a map with two keys, =:READ= and =:UPDATE=

** A Small Reformation Example
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(ns example
 (:require [reformation.core :as rfc]))

(def example-atom (atom nil)
(def easy-form [:example-element {:type :text
                                   :label "Enter some text here"}])

(rfc/render-application easy-form example-atom)

*** Diving Deeper
A Reformation form is defined by two parts:  a vector of pairs describing the form, and a place to store the data.  

**** The Vector
A form is specified by a vector of pairs.  The first part of each pair is a keyword.  You can use whatever keywords you want; the resulting data structure will store user input data under the same keys, e.g. a form described by =[:example-element {:type :text :label "Enter some text here"}]= would store the data as ={:example-element "user input for the text input lives here"}=.  

The second part of each pair---={:type :text :label "Enter some text here"}= in the above example---describes a form element.  (See "A Bigger Form" below for examples, and "Element and Attribute Reference" below that).

**** Data Storage
Where does the data live?

***** An Atom
=render-application= can take an atom as a second argument and keep user input there.  The atom should either contain =nil= or a map.

***** Custom Storage
If you have more specific needs (a front-end db, etc), instead of an atom, you can pass =render-application= a map containing read and write functions for Reformation to use, under the keys =:READ= and =:WRITE=.  The function under =:READ= should take one argument: a vector of keys representing a path as in =get-in=.  The function under =:UPDATE= should take =[path new-val-f]=, where =new-val-f= is a zero-argument function that returns the new value.

** Element and Attribute Reference

*** universal keys
**** =:type=
indicates which element to create.  Can be any of: =:select= =:multi-table= =:textarea= =:togglebox= =:checkbox= =:file= =:hidden=

**** =:subtext=
Explanatory or parenthetical text, appearing in smaller font under =:label=

**** =:validation-function=
should be a predicate function that takes a value and determines whether it is a valid input for that form element

**** =:invalid-feedback=
If the input doesn't satisfy the validation function, this string will appear explaining why

**** =:required?=
a boolean flag indicating whether the element is required for form submission.  Not applicable to  =togglebox or =multi-table=

**** =:default-value= 
If you wish to set a default value, put it here
     
**** =:disabled=
a binary flag for whether the element will be disabled

**** =:id= 
 the =id= of the resulting element
**** =:style-classes=
is set as =:class= of the resulting element


** Elements

*** =:select=
**** =:on-change= equivalent to the __onChange__ attribute in HTML
**** =:options= a sequence of options from which the user can select one.  An option can be either a value, or a map with two keys, =:content= and =:value=.  In this case, =:content= is displaye to the user, but the data read is that in =:value=.

*** =:textarea=

 =:placeholder= as the HTML attribute.

=:value= as the html attribute

=:char-count= a map with two keys, =:limit= and =:enforce?=.  =:limit= is a character count limit and should be an integer, =:enforce?= is a boolean.


*** checkbox
a checkbox.

*** file
**** =:submit-text= Text instructing the user how to submit a file.  Defaults to  "Click or Drop a File Here"
**** =:submit-button= a 
**** =:submit-fn=
**** =:save-fn= should be a fn of one argument, the file
**** =:allowed-extensions-f= a set of strings, each representing a file extension, e.g. #{"txt" "doc"}


  [{:keys [ submit-text submit-fn error-text submit-button ]
    :or {submit-text "Click or Drop a File Here"}
    {:keys [drag-over inactive have-file]
     :or {drag-over "dragover"
          inactive "undragged"
          have-file "have-file"}} :style-classes
    :as opt-map}]



*** togglebox  ---composite
 [ content

 override-inline? not sure

 open-height not sure

]


*** multi-table

*** hidden
